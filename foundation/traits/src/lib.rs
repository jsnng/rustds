/// Two-stage zero-copy/alloc decoder trait.
///
/// `Decode` models a two-stage parsing strategy for a buffer holding bytes.
///  1. `populate` reads the bytes from some buffer `buf` and performs validation/parse pass on the borrowed
///     `buf` and returns a reference to buf encapsulated by type `Span` with lifetime `'a`. This span must
///     not allocate; return `Err` of type `Error` for validation/parsing errors.
///  2. `own` consumes the Self (i.e., borrowed `Span`) and returns an owned `Owned` value. `own` is allowed to allocate;
///     callers should call it when they need ownership i.e., lazily own. Implmenentations must copy or clone
///     so the returned value is not constrained by the lifetime `'a`.
///
/// # Implementing `Decode`
///
/// Implementors typically set `type Span = Self`, making the `Span` type the implementor of the trait.
/// `populate` acts as a validating constructor that returns the borrowed `Span`; `own` is then used to
/// perform the allocation into the `Owned` form.
///
